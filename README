C++0x Contracts
===============

Contract Programming (CP) allows to specify preconditions, postconditions, and class invariants that are automatically checked when functions are executed at run-time. These conditions assert program specifications within the source code itself, allowing to find bugs more quickly during testing, making the code self-documenting, and increasing overall software quality.

Contract Programming is also known as Design by Contract (DbC) and it was first introduced by the Eiffel programming language. This library supports the **simplest features** of Eiffel Contract programming, preconditions and postconditions, with no inheritance.

This library requires C++0x or newer versions of C++ language.
